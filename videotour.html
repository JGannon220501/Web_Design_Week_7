		<p>Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of Theobroma cocoa seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavoured with vanilla. 
		It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavouring ingredient in other foods. Cocoa has been cultivated by many cultures 
		for at least three millenia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya(Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages 
		dating back to 1900 BCE. The seeds if the cacoa tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavour. After fermentation, the
		beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadultered chocolate in rough form. 
		Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids 
		and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugars. </p>

		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
		when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centurie, but also the leap 
		into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. it was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
		passage, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
